# FHIR-29796 PDex Device uses base resource not US Core Implantable Device Profile. Pdex-Device enables payers to record non-implantable device data.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex/StructureDefinition/pdex-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile


# FHIR-29797 PDex profiles based on Provenance resource and not US Core Provenance Profile. Pdex-Provenance is defined to enable payers to record source format of data. Payers do not have sufficient data to accurately complete US Core Provenance
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex/StructureDefinition/pdex-provenance').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Provenance derive from the core US profile
