# FHIR-29796 PDex Device uses base resource not US Core Implantable Device Profile. Pdex-Device enables payers to record non-implantable device data. CGP Voted on variance approval: Drew Torres/Eric Haas: 9-0-0
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex/StructureDefinition/pdex-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process
