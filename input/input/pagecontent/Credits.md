## Terminology

This IG defaults to using US Core Profiles and value sets. 

If a resource is required that is not part of US Core it will be defined and referenced in the HRex IG. HRex is used to reference profiles that are utilized across multiple Da Vinci IGs.

If a resource is unique to the PDex IG it will be defined in this guide, together with any unique value sets or coding systems required to support the profile.
