have the appropriate credentials to access the secured APIs.

The $davinci-data-export operation should support the export of Profiles supporting US Core 3.1.1 or US Core 6.1.0.
Other profiles that can be included in the export are:
- CARIN Blue Button non-Financial Profiles.
- PDex Prior Authorization Profile.
