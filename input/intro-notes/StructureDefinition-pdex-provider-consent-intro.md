### Provider Access Opt-out

The CMS Prior Authorization Rule (CMS-0057) requires that a health plan enables a member to choose to opt-out of sharing their data
with providers via the [Provider Access API](provider-access-api.html). By default a member is opted-in to data sharing with Providers
that have an existing, or impending treatment relationship. This implementation Guide provides a [Consent profile](StructureDefinition-pdex-provider-consent.html)
that expresses a Member's decision to opt-out, i.e., Deny sharing of their data, A Member can also revoke that denial.
