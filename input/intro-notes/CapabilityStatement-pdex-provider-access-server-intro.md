This capability statement is for use with the Provider Access Bulk API.
It makes the $davinci-data-export operations available to in-network providers that
have the appropriate credentials to access the secured APIs via a group resource that provides a list
of Patients/Members that are identified as having a treatment relationship and have not opted out of sharing
their data with providers.

The $davinci-data-export operation should support the export of Profiles supporting US Core 3.1.1 or US Core 6.1.0.
Other profiles that can be included in the export are:
- CARIN Blue Button non-Financial Profiles.
- PDex Prior Authorization Profile.
