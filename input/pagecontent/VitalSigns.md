[Previous Page - US Core Smoking Status Observation](USCoreSmokingStatusObservation.html)

This IG supports the full complement of US Core profiles. They are supported to 
enable a payer to produce FHIR resources from data provided in other formats.

For some resources payers are unlikely to have the clinical information necessary to create a valid US Core resource. The [Vital Signs](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-vitalsigns.html) is referenced in US Core but uses the profile 
from the base FHIR specification and does not create a US Core specific 
profile. Payers may be unable to create a valid Vital Signs record from the source clinical data they have available.

A Vital Signs resource requires a status, a magic value for what is being measured, the patient information and a time when the observation was taken. Payers may 
not have access to the detail measurement data needed to create a valid 
Vital Signs resource.
