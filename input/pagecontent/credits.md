### Da Vinci

[Da Vinci](https://www.hl7.org/about/davinci/index.cfm) is an HL7-sponsored project that brings together U.S. payers, providers, and technology suppliers to help payers and providers improve clinical, quality, cost, and care management outcomes using FHIR-related technologies. The project organizes meetings (face-to-face and conference calls) and connectathons to find ways to leverage FHIR technologies to support and integrate value-based care (VBC) data exchange across communities. Da Vinci identifies value-based care use cases of interest to its members and to the broader community.

The process that Da Vinci has adopted includes:

1. identifying business, clinical, technical, and testing requirements
2. developing and balloting a FHIR-based implementation guide (IG)
3. developing reference implementations (RIs) to demonstrate that the concepts in the IG are possible to implement
4. piloting the standard
5. supporting the production use of the IG to enable exchange of data to support interoperability for value-based care

All Da Vinci work adheres to a common set of [guiding principles](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ehrx/davinci-guiding-principles.html).

Additional information about Da Vinci, its members, the use cases, and the implementation guides being developed can all be found on the [HL7 website](http://www.hl7.org/about/davinci). Meeting minutes and other materials can be found on the [Da Vinci Confluence page](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/DVP).

### The Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) project

This Implementation Guide was made possible by the thoughtful contributions of the following people and organizations.

This Implementation Guide was the work of the [Da Vinci Accelerator Project's](http://www.hl7.org/about/davinci/index.cfm?ref=common) PDex work group and Da Vinci member organizations.

The [PDex work group can be found on confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=116462704).

### Terminology

This IG defaults to using US Core Profiles and value sets. 

If a resource is required that is not part of US Core it will be defined and referenced in the HRex IG. HRex is used to reference profiles that are utilized across multiple Da Vinci IGs.

If a resource is unique to the PDex IG it will be defined in this guide, together with any unique value sets or coding systems required to support the profile.
