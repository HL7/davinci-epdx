The PDex PriorAuthorization profile has been created to enable Payers to communicate prior authorization decisions and changes to the status of a prior authorization to members.

Payers are expected to communicate pending and active prior authorization decisions and related clinical documentation and forms for items and services, not including prescription drugs, including the date the prior authorization was approved, the date the authorization ends, as well as the units and services approved and those used to date, no later than one (1) business day after a provider initiates a prior authorization for the enrollee or there is a change of status for the prior authorization.
