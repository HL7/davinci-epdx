When a new patient registers with a Provider a request for information about the patient can be issued to the Payer providing health coverage. 

This request can be triggered in one of two ways:
1.	When an appointment is being confirmed
2.	When the patient checks-in for the appointment

These triggers will be configured as CDS-Hooks that are initiated as part of provider workflows.
