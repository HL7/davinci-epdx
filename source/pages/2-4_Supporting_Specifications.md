There are a few places in this implementation guide marked as **TODO**. All such areas represent supplementary content such as examples, additional background or context or other non-definitional content. I.e. they do not change any of the conformance expectations on implementers. Where **TODO** appears, such content will be created and included in the implementation guide prior to publication as a Standard for Trial Use.
