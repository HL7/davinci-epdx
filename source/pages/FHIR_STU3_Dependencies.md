An important design consideration for the Da Vinci project is to minimize the effort for implementation for both payers and providers. Therefore, wherever possible this IG will utilize existing profiles, such as those developed by US Core or the Argonaut project. 

Since FHIR R4 was only released in January 2019 this IG will also support US Core STU2 profiles that are based on FHIR STU3.

The profiles referenced in this implementation Guide include:
* [US Core AllergyIntolerance Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU2/StructureDefinition-us-core-allergyintolerance.html)
* [US Core Condition Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU2/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition.html)
* [US Core Device Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU2/StructureDefinition-us-core-device.html)
* [US Core DiagnosticReport Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU2/StructureDefinition-us-core-diagnosticreport.html)
