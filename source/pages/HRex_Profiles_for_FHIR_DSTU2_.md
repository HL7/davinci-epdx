active: HRex Profiles for FHIR DSTU2 
---

While the PDex IG is based on the FHIR R4 specification the Da Vinci project is committed to supporting earlier versions of the specification to enable easier integration for EMR systems that currently support FHIR DSTU2. This requires the creation of profiles that were not included in the original set of Argonaut profiles.

The additional DSTU2 Profiles include:

* Coverage
* Encounter
* Location
* Organization
* Practitioner
* Provenance
