The PDex IG is specifying three exchange interactions:
 
1. Providers and Health Plans (payers) exchanging information about the Member that a provider is caring for (P2HPX).
2. Health Plans via a Member authorized exchange when a Member has moved from enrollment in one health plan to another health plan (MauthHPX).
3. Health Plans and Third Party Applications that a Member has authorized to share the health information held by the health plan.

Two subsidiary Payer Data exchange Implementation Guides address the Member-authorized sharing of Health Plan information with Third Party Applications (Mauth3PX): 
- Healthcare Network Directory.
- Pharmacy Network Directory.
- Prescription Drug Formulary.

These subsidiary IGs are:
- Payer Data exchange Plan Network Directory (PDex-plan-net) IG covering Healthcare and Pharmacy networks.
- Payer Data exchange Drug formulary (PDex-formulart) IG covering prescription drug formulary.
