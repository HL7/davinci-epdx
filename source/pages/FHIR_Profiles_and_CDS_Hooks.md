active: FHIR Profiles and CDS Hooks
---

This specification makes significant use of FHIR profiles, search parameter definitions and terminology artifacts to describe the content to be shared as part of CDS Hook calls. The implementation guide supports three versions of FHIR: DSTU2, STU3 and R4 and profiles for both are listed for each type of hook.

The profiles referenced in this implementation guide use Argonaut (based on FHIR DSTU2) and US Core (based on STU3 and R4) or, where profiles are not defined in those specifications, profiles defined in the HRex Implementation Guide.
