* Point to CDS Hooks spec
** https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/
* Add hooks defined in CRD:
** https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#cds-hooks
** Note that if CDS hooks core spec adopts these, will deprecate here. We will automatically adopt the latest published version of CDS Hooks. 
** Keep the implementation and payload for the hooks in the PDex guide (and other guides).
