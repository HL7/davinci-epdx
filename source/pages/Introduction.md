The Da Vinci Payer Health Record exchange (HRex) initiative is specifying the FHIR profiles, functions, operations, such as CDS-Hooks and other aspects of Da Vinci Use Cases that are common across more than a single use case. 

Da Vinci HRex Implementation Guide (IG) will make use of US Core profiles that are based on the FHIR R4 specification wherever practicable. The HRex IG will use the HL7 FHIR Release 4/US Core STU3 specification as its base, but will provide additional guidance and documentation to support implementations that follow the HL7 FHIR STU3/US Core STU2 and HL7 FHIR DSTU2/Argonaut specifications. 

The HRex profiles documented in this IG will be used to transmit data between payer and provider systems. The mechanisms used for this interaction will be based upon the CDS-Hooks specification and on other standard FHIR operations. 

The HRex IG will define any new hooks that are currently outside of the core CDS-Hooks specification. These hooks may be deprecated in the future if/when the hooks defined in this IG are migrated to the core CDS-Hooks specification.
