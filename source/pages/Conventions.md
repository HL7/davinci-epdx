This implementation guide uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

SHALL indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

SHOULD indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to) but which do not, for this verion of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

MAY describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but where the is no recommendation for or against adoption.
