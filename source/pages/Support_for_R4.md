The hooks published in the CDS Hooks specification provide a list of context resources for the DSTU2 and STU3 versions of FHIR. The CDS Hook specification won't be updated to include R4 resources until after R4 is finalized. Because this implementation guide is being written to support FHIR R4 as well as STU3 and Argonaut (DSTU2), it provides guidance on what R4 resources are relevant for each hook (both pre-existing hooks as well as newly proposed hooks).

It is possible that the actual list of R4 resources provided for the hooks will differ from that proposed in this IG. Future versions of the implementation guide will adjust accordingly.
