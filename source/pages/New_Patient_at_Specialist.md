When a patient presents at a specialist a request for information about the patient can be issued to the Payer providing health coverage.

This request can be triggered in one of two ways:
1.	When an appointment is being confirmed
2.	When the patient checks-in for the appointment

This use can may differ slightly from the New Patient Use Case by the Specialist wanting to know if the patient is attributed to a Primary Care Provider.
