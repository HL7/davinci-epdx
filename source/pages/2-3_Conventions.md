This implementation guide (IG) uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

**SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

**SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to) but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

**MAY** describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but where there is no recommendation for, or against, adoption.

It is important to differentiate in the Implementation Guide between identifiers used by the Provider/EMR and those used by the Payer/Health Plan to identify the patient/subject/member.

For the purposes of this IG we will use the following terms:

* **patient** or **subject** id will be used to express the identifier used by the provider to identify a patient/subject.

* **subscriber** or **member** id will be used to express the identifier used by the payer/health plan to identify a member.
