This implementation guide addresses three use cases:
* New Patient at Primary Care Provider
* Returning Patient at Primary Care Provider
* New Patient at Specialist

The examples used in this guide are based on Payers providing claims from events where a member visits an ambulatory provider.

	</i></td></tr>
