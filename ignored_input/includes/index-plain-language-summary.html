<p><a href="http://hl7.org/">HL7</a>, which stands for Health Level Seven, creates standards to help different healthcare computer systems talk to each other. These HL7 standards are a special language or set of rules that lets information be shared between hospitals, doctors’ offices (e.g. Electronic Health Record Systems), labs, patients (e.g. via patient portals), pharmacies, and insurers, among others.</p>

<p>One of the HL7 standards is HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). It helps connect healthcare systems, making it easier for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to share important information about patients. For example, if you have a lab test at a hospital, HL7 FHIR helps send the results to your doctor’s office so they can provide the right care.</p>

      <p>A goal of HL7 is to make sure everyone involved in your healthcare has the right information at the right time. Our standards help machines and people, including you, work together to make better decisions for your health. HL7 sets rules that computer systems follow, so they can understand and share information in a consistent and reliable way.</p>

<p>To learn more about HL7, you can visit the website <a href="http://hl7.org/">HL7</a>.</p>

      <p>The people at HL7 make guides that explain how to use the rules (standards) for different things. These guides bring the rules together and show how to use them for specific purposes.</p>

<p>The HL7 Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) Implementation Guide defines methods (Application Programming Interfaces or APIs) that enable a Health Plan to make
    data available to Patients, Providers and other Payers. The Guide addresses three scenarios that enable:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Patients to share the data held about them by the health plan to applications or services they trust.</li>
          <li>Providers to retrieve the data they need, that the health plan holds, about the patients they are treating.</li>
          <li>Payers to retrieve the data about a newly-enrolled member that asks them to fetch their data from their old health plan.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Guide enables the exchange of the following information to members:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Clinical information</li>
          <li>Prior Authorization information</li>
      </ul>
<p>In addition, the Guide enables Providers and Payers to also receive the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Claims and Encounter data without the monetary values that the Member is able to see.</li>
</ul>

      <p>This guide works in conjunction with other important Implementation Guides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>US Core, the clinical FHIR standards to exchange clinical data in the USA.</li>
    <li>CARIN Blue Button, that enables members to receive claims and encounter information.</li>
    <li>Da Vinci Prior Authorization Support that enables the health plan to receive Prior Authorization requests and provide the response.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Guide is recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the 2024 Prior Authorization Rule (CMS-0057) that requires
Medicare Advantage health plans, State Medicaid agencies and Individual Qualified Health Plans to provide these standardized APIs to enable easier exchange of information
    for the benefit of health plan members.</p>
