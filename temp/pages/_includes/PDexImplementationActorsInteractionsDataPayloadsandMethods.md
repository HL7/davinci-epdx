This section defines the Actors, Exchange Interactions and Data Payloads covered by the PDex IG.

The Member Health History is represented as a series of FHIR Resources that are based on a superset of [HL7 FHIR US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/), HRex and PDex profiles. The content/payload of the Member Health History may be augmented by FHIR resources that are generated outputs from other HL7 Da Vinci IG use cases, such as Coverage Requirements Determination.
