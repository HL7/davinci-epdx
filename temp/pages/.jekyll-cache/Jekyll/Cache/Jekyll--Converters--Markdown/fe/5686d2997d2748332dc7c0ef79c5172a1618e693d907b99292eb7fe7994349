<p>This implementation guide sets expectations for two types of systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Client Systems</li>
  <li>Payer Systems</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="client-systems">Client Systems</h3>
<p>Client systems are electronic medical records, pharmacy systems and other clinical and administrative systems responsible for the ordering and execution of patient-related services. These are systems whose users have a need for discovery of patient information from health plans who have provided coverage to the patient.</p>

<h3 id="payer-systems">Payer Systems</h3>
<p>Payer systems are systems run by health plans/insurers that provide insurance coverage to the patient and can provide claims history clinical information and benefits information about the patient.</p>

<p>The requirements and expectations described here are not intended to be exhaustive. Health plans and clients <strong>MAY</strong> support additional hooks, additional card patterns, additional resources, additional extensions, etc. The purpose of this implementation guide is to establish a baseline of expected behavior that communication partners can rely on and then build from. Future versions of this specification will evolve based on implementer feedback.</p>
