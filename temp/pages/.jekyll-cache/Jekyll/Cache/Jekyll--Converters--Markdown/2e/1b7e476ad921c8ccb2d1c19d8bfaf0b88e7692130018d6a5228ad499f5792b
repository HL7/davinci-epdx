<p>This implementation guide addresses a Provider-to-Payer use case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Patient at Primary Care Provider</li>
</ul>

<p>The other use case is for Member/Patient-mediated Payer-to-Payer Exchange:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consumer enrolls with new health plan and accesses their prior health plan to authorize sharing of the health history that the prior health plan holds on the consumer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The examples used in this guide are based on Payers providing claims from events where a member visits an ambulatory provider or when a member switches health plans.</p>

<p>Three example data requests from Providers to Health Plans are covered in this IG and the associated Reference Implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What Encounters has the patient had since mm/dd/yyyy, excluding encounters at my organization.</li>
  <li>What procedures has the patient had?</li>
  <li>What medications has the patient received (i.e. A claim for a medication has been settled by the health plan)</li>
</ol>
