<p>The patient calls their provider to arrange a follow-up appointment.</p>

<p>The receptionist in the doctors office collects their personal information, checks for any change in health plan coverage information and creates an appointment, a patient record and an initial encounter record.</p>

<p>The creation of an appointment activates a CDS Hook transaction: appointment-book.</p>

<p>In this scenario the Clinician that reviews the Member History is only interested in information in the Member record since their last visit and <strong>MAY</strong> want to exclude information from their own organization, since that information will already be recorded in their EMR system.</p>
