<p>The following actors are recognized in the PDex IG:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Health Plan</strong>: The Insurance entity, or Payer, who handles claims for services provided to their plan members.</li>
  <li><strong>Member</strong>: The health plan member / patient who is, or was, a member of a health plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Provider</strong>: The practitioner or clinician, or their representative, that initiates a data access request to retrieve member data from a health plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Application</strong>: Health Plan Members / Patients have a right under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to direct the information held by a covered entity, such as a Hospital or Health Plan to a third party of their choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different terms used for an individual or patient in the Health Plan industry. Terms such as subscriber or member may be used. A subscriber and a member are not necessarily equivalent. For example the subscriber may be the primary family member on a plan that covers the entire family. Therefore the term Member will will be used through out this guide to identify the indivudal subject of the ‚Äúmember health history‚Äù.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this IG a covered entity, such as a Provider, may create an application for connection to a Health Plan FHIR API.</p>
