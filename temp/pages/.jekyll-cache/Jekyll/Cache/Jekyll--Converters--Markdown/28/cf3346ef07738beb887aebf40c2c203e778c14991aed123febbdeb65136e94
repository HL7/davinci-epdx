<p>The PDex IG is specifying three exchange interactions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Providers and Health Plans (payers) exchanging information about the Member that a provider is caring for (P2HPX).</li>
  <li>Health Plans via a Member authorized exchange when a Member has moved from enrollment in one health plan to another health plan (MauthHPX).</li>
  <li>Health Plans and Third Party Applications that a Member has authorized to share the health information held by the health plan.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two subsidiary Payer Data exchange Implementation Guides address the Member-authorized sharing of Health Plan information with Third Party Applications (Mauth3PX):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Healthcare Network Directory.</li>
  <li>Pharmacy Network Directory.</li>
  <li>Prescription Drug Formulary.</li>
</ul>

<p>These subsidiary IGs are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payer Data exchange Plan Network Directory (PDex-plan-net) IG covering Healthcare and Pharmacy networks: http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/</li>
  <li>Payer Data exchange Drug formulary (PDex-formulart) IG covering prescription drug formulary: http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/</li>
</ul>
