<p>Member/Patient Consent for scenarios covered in this Implementation Guide fall into two areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Provider-Health Plan Exchange</li>
  <li>Member-mediated Information Exchange</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="provider-health-plan-exchange">Provider-Health Plan Exchange</h3>

<p>Provider-Health Plan exchange of data is covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) under the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/disclosures-treatment-payment-health-care-operations/index.html">Treatment Payment and Health Care Operations</a> provision.</p>

<h3 id="member-mediated-information-exchange">Member-mediated Information Exchange</h3>

<p>The CMS Notice For Proposed Rule Making for Patient access and Interoperability requires that a subscriber to a new health plan <strong>SHALL</strong> be able to request their information to be passed from their old health plan to their new health plan.</p>

<p>A Member <strong>SHALL</strong> also be able to use APIs to share information with Third Party Applications. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their health history</li>
  <li>Healthcare network/directory information</li>
  <li>Pharmacy network/directory information</li>
  <li>Prescription Drug Formulary information</li>
</ul>

<p>The Member-mediated Information Exchange method will build upon established OAuth2.0 protocols for patient access to their health and claims information that enables the sharing of information with third-party applications. The health history payload for the exchange would be the same FHIR resources that are passed to providers under the Provider-Payer exchange scenario.</p>

<p>The exchange of Healthcare network/directory information and Pharmacy network/directory information is covered in the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/">PDex-plan-net IG</a>.
The exchange of Prescription drug formulary information is covered in the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/">PDex-formulary IG</a>.</p>

<p>The OAuth2.0-based exchange is covered in detail in <a href="7_Member-Authorized_OAuth2_Exchange.html">Section 7</a></p>
