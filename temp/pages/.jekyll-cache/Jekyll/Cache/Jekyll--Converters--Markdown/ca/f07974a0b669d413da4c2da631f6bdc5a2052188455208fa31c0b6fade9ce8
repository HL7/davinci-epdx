	How could Health Plan initiated data exchange be handled?
    </i>
</td></tr>

<p>The Payer Data exchange Implementation Guide defines methods for Providers to request information from Health Plans.</p>

<p>This IG does not cover the Payer-initiated transfer of unsolicited information to a provider. All Provider-oriented exchanges will be initiated as part of a Provider workflow, such as when a new patient presents for an appointment, using CDS-Hooks or triggered via a manual interaction with a SMART-on-FHIR app that generates the necessary CDS-Hook.</p>

<p>All search parameters and subsequent filtering of returned information <strong>SHALL</strong> be controlled by the Provider making the information request.  The Payer does not filter information that has been requested by the provider.</p>

<p>Health Plans should only restrict provider access to a memberâ€™s data where that access is required in accordance with State or Federal regulations.</p>

<p>Health Plan to Health Plan or Third-Party Application exchange is controlled by the Member using an OAuth2.0 Authorization.</p>
