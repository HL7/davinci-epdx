<p>There are a few places in this implementation guide marked as <strong>TODO</strong>. All such areas represent supplementary content such as examples, additional background, context or other non-definitional content. I.e. they do not change any of the conformance expectations on implementers.</p>

<p>Where <strong>TODO</strong> appears, such content will be created and included in the implementation guide prior to publication as a Standard for Trial Use.</p>
