<p>This section defines the Actors, Exchange Interactions and Data Payloads covered by the PDex IG.</p>

<p>The Member Health History is represented as a series of FHIR Resources that are based on a superset of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">HL7 FHIR US Core</a>, HRex and PDex profiles. The content/payload of the Member Health History may be augmented by FHIR resources that are generated outputs from other HL7 Da Vinci IG use cases, such as Coverage Requirements Determination.</p>
