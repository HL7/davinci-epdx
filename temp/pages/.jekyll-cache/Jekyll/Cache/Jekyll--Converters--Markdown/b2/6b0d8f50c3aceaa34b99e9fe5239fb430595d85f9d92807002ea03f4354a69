<p>Member/Patient Consent for scenarios covered in this Implementation Guide fall into two areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Provider-Health Plan Exchange</li>
  <li>Member-mediated Information Exchange</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="provider-health-plan-exchange">Provider-Health Plan Exchange</h3>

<p>Provider-Health Plan exchange of data is covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) under the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/disclosures-treatment-payment-health-care-operations/index.html">Treatment Payment and Health Care Operations</a> ( https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/disclosures-treatment-payment-health-care-operations/index.html ) provision.</p>

<h3 id="member-mediated-information-exchange">Member-mediated Information Exchange</h3>

<p>The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Rule requires that a member to a new health plan <strong>SHALL</strong> be able to request their information be passed from their old health plan to their new health plan.</p>

<p>The CMS rule also specifies that all data from the memberâ€™s health record that is held by the health plan since January 1, 2016 be available via API.</p>

<p>A Member <strong>SHALL</strong> also be able to use APIs to share information with Third Party Applications. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their health history</li>
  <li>Healthcare network/directory information</li>
  <li>Pharmacy network/directory information</li>
  <li>Prescription Drug Formulary information</li>
</ul>

<p>The Member-mediated Information Exchange method will build upon established OAuth2.0 protocols for patient access to their health and claims information that enables the sharing of information with third-party applications. The process of Member Authentication, typically using the memberâ€™s user credentials from the Health Planâ€™s portal, and OAuth2.0 authorization to share will form the basis of the member Consent to share.</p>

<p>The health history payload for the exchange would be the same FHIR resources that are passed to providers under the Provider-Payer exchange scenario.</p>

<p>The exchange of Healthcare network/directory information and Pharmacy network/directory information is covered in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/2020Feb/">PDex-plan-net IG</a> ( http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/2020Feb/ ).
The exchange of Prescription drug formulary information is covered in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/Davinci-drug-formulary//">PDex-formulary IG</a> ( http://hl7.org/fhir/us/Davinci-drug-formulary/ ).</p>

<p>The OAuth2.0-based exchange is covered in detail in the <a href="Member-Authorized_OAuth2_Exchange.html">Member-Authorized OAuth2 Exchange</a></p>
