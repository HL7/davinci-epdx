<p>This implementation guide (IG) uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:</p>

<p><strong>SHALL</strong> indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.</p>

<p><strong>SHOULD</strong> indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to) but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.</p>

<p><strong>MAY</strong> describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but where there is no recommendation for, or against, adoption.</p>

<p>It is important to differentiate in the Implementation Guide between identifiers used by the Provider/EMR and those used by the Payer/Health Plan to identify the patient/subject/member.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this IG we will use the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>patient</strong> or <strong>subject</strong> id will be used to express the identifier used by the provider to identify a patient/subject.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>member</strong> id will be used to express the identifier used by the payer/health plan to identify an individual member. Health Plans may historically have referred to these individual members as:</li>
  <li>Member</li>
  <li>Subscriber</li>
  <li>Beneficiary</li>
  <li>Dependent</li>
  <li>Group Member</li>
  <li>Plan Member</li>
  <li>Covered Party</li>
  <li>Subject of Care</li>
</ul>
