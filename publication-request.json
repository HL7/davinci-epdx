  "descmd": "This STU2.1 specification has undergone ballot and connectathon testing. It is expected to continue to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.\nFeedback is welcome and may be submitted through the FHIR JIRA tracker indicating US Da Vinci PDex as the specification.  If balloting on this IG, please submit your comments via the tracker and reference them in your ballot submission implementation guide.\n\nThis guide can be reviewed offline.

It describes the interaction patterns that, when followed, allow the various parties involved in managing healthcare and payer data to more easily integrate and exchange data securely and effectively.\n\nThis IG covers the exchange of:\n- Claims-based information (without financials)\n- Clinical Information (such as Lab Results, Allergies and Conditions)\n- Prior Authorization information\n\nThis IG covers the exchange of this information using US Core and Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HRex) Profiles. This superset of clinical profiles forms the Health History for a Health Plan Member. \n\nThis IG covers the exchange of the Health History for a member in the following scenarios:\n- Provider requested exchange using SMART-on-FHIR Bulk exchange\n- Health Plan Exchange using SMART-on-FHIR\n- Member-authorized Health Plan to Health Plan exchange\n- Member-authorized Health Plan to Third-Party Application exchange\n\nThe latter two scenarios are provided to meet the requirements identified in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule.\n\n**There are items in this guide that are subject to update**. This includes:\n- Value Sets\n- Vocabularies (X12, NUBC etc.)\n- Examples\n\n**The Vocabulary, Value Sets and codings used to express data in this IG are subject to review and will be reconciled with**  [X12](http://www.x12.org).\n\nSee the [Table of Contents](toc.html) for more information.\n",
