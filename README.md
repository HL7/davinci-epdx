is found in the fishtank (input/fsh) folder in this repository.

Check out the README.md in the Fishtank folder for instructions on compiling the IG using Sushi.

The primary author of this IG is: Mark Scrimshire of OnyxHealth.io. You can reach him at mark@ekivemark.com.

## Environment setup

Update to latest Sushi:

    npm install -g fsh-sushi

Check Sushi Version:

     sushi -v


## Building the IG

Run the following commands from the base directory.

To run Sushi only:

    sushi fsh -o ./input

To prepare to run the publisher:

    ./_updatePublisher.sh
    
The following command will also run sushi since the FSH files are in the /fsh folder.

To run the publisher:

    ./_genonce.sh
    
If publisher has timeout issues when running sushi. edit the fsh.ini file to adjust the timeout value.
