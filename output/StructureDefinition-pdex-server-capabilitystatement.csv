A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do?

The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system.

For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system.

For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system.

For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system.

For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Profiles for use cases supported","A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system. For a server, ""supported by the system"" means the system hosts/produces a set of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#profile-uses).","Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
