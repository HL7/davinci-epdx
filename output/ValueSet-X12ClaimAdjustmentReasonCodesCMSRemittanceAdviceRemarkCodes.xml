  <description value="X12, chartered by the American National Standards Institute for more than 40 years, develops and maintains EDI standards and XML schemas which drive business processes globally. X12's diverse membership includes technologists and business process experts in health care, insurance, transportation, finance, government, supply chain and other industries.&#xA;&#xA;The X12 Claim Adjustment Reason Codes describe why a claim or service line was paid differently than it was billed. These codes are listed within an X12 implementation guide (TR3) and maintained by X12.&#xA;&#xA;Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs) are used to provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a Claim Adjustment Reason Code (CARC) or to convey information about remittance processing.&#xA;&#xA;Each RARC identifies a specific message as shown in the Remittance Advice Remark Code List. There are two types of RARCs, supplemental and informational. The majority of the RARCs are supplemental; these are generally referred to as RARCs without further distinction. Supplemental RARCs provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a CARC. The second type of RARC is informational; these RARCs are all prefaced with Alert: and are often referred to as Alerts. Alerts are used to convey information about remittance processing and are never related to a specific adjustment or CARC.&#xA;&#xA;External code lists maintained by X12 and external code lists maintained by others and distributed by WPC on behalf of the maintainer can be found here:&#xA;&#xA;[https://x12.org/codes](https://x12.org/codes)&#xA;&#xA;Click on the name of any external code list to access more information about the code list, view the codes, or submit a maintenance request. These external code lists were previously published on either [www.wpc-edi.com/reference](http://www.wpc-edi.com/reference) or [www.x12.org/codes](http://www.x12.org/codes)."/>
