[US Core Provenance Profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-provenance.html) is provided as a reference for situations where payers
receive detailed clinical data via formats such as C-CDA and in converting to a
FHIR format are able to identify the detailed information about the originating 
event and can therefore create an appropriate Provenance record.

In all other cases a payer SHALL create a [PDex Provenance](PDexProvenance.html)
profile that identifies their role as a "Transmitter" of the information.
