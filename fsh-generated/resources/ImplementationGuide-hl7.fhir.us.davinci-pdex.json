  "description": "This specification has undergone ballot and connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.\nFeedback is welcome and may be submitted through the FHIR JIRA tracker indicating US Da Vinci PDex as the specification. If balloting on this IG, please submit your comments via the tracker and reference them in your ballot submission implementation guide.\n\nThis guide can be reviewed offline. Go to the Downloads section. Click on the link to download the full Implementation Guide as a zip file. Expand the zip file and use a web browser to launch the index.html file in the directory created by the zip extract process. External hyperlinks in the guide will not be available unless you have an active internet connection. \n\n[Financial Management](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FM/Financial+Management+Home) is the Sponsoring Work Group for this Implementation Guide.\n\n**The Payer Data Exchange (PDex) Implementation Guide (IG) is provided for Payers/Health Plans to enable them to create a Member's Health History using clinical resources (based on US Core 3.1.1 Profiles based on FHIR R4) which can be understood by providers and, if they choose to, committed to their Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System.**\n\nThe PDex work group has made changes to the original version of the IG following the publication of the final CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Rule.\n\nThis IG uses the same Member Health History \"payload\" for member-authorized exchange of information with other Health Plans and with Third-Party Applications. It describes the interaction patterns that, when followed, allow the various parties involved in managing healthcare and payer data to more easily integrate and exchange data securely and effectively.\n\nThis IG covers the exchange of:\n- Claims-based information\n- Clinical Information (such as Lab Results, Allergies and Conditions)\n\nThis IG covers the exchange of this information using US Core and Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HRex) Profiles. This superset of clinical profiles forms the Health Plan Member's Health History. \n\nThis IG covers the exchange of a Member's Health History in the following scenarios:\n- Provider requested Provider-Health Plan Exchange using CDS-Hooks and SMART-on-FHIR\n- Member-authorized Health Plan to Health Plan exchange\n- Member-authorized Health Plan to Third-Party Application exchange\n\nThe latter two scenarios are provided to meet the requirements identified in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule.\n\n**There are items in this guide that are subject to update**. This includes:\n- Value Sets\n- Vocabularies (X12, NUBC etc.)\n- Examples\n\n**The Vocabulary, Value Sets and codings used to express data in this IG are subject to review and will be reconciled with**  [X12](http://www.x12.org).\n\nSee the [Table of Contents](toc.html) for more information.\n",

(See Section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) (21 U.S.C. § 360)). Drug products are identified and reported using a unique, three-segment number, called the National Drug Code (NDC), which serves as a universal product identifier for drugs. FDA publishes the listed NDC numbers and the information submitted as part of the listing information in the NDC Directory which is updated daily.\n\nThe information submitted as part of the listing process, the NDC number, and the NDC Directory are used in the implementation and enforcement of the Act.\n\nUsers should note:\n\nStarting June 1, 2011, only drugs for which electronic listings (SPL) have been submitted to the FDA are included in the NDC Directory. Drugs for which listing information was last submitted to FDA on paper forms, prior to June 2009, are included on a separate file and will not be updated after June 2012.\n\nInformation regarding the FDA published NDC Directory can be found [here](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory)\n\nUsers should note a few important items\n\n*   The NDC Directory is updated daily.\n*   The new NDC Directory contains ONLY information on final marketed drugs submitted to the FDA in SPL electronic listing files by labelers.\n*   The NDC Directory does not contain all listed drugs. The new version includes the final marketed drugs which listing information were submitted electronically. It does not include animal drugs, blood products, or human drugs that are not in final marketed form, such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients(APIs), drugs for further processing, drugs manufactured exclusively for a private label distributor, or drugs that are marketed solely as part of a kit or combination product or inner layer of a multi-level packaged product not marketed individually. For more information about how certain kits or multi-level packaged drugs are addressed in the new NDC Directory, see the NDC Directory Package File definitions document.

X12's diverse membership includes technologists and business process experts in health care, insurance, transportation, finance, government, supply chain and other industries.\n\nThe X12 Claim Adjustment Reason Codes describe why a claim or service line was paid differently than it was billed. These codes are listed within an X12 implementation guide (TR3) and maintained by X12.\n\nRemittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs) are used to provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a Claim Adjustment Reason Code (CARC) or to convey information about remittance processing.\n\nEach RARC identifies a specific message as shown in the Remittance Advice Remark Code List. There are two types of RARCs, supplemental and informational. The majority of the RARCs are supplemental; these are generally referred to as RARCs without further distinction. Supplemental RARCs provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a CARC. The second type of RARC is informational; these RARCs are all prefaced with Alert: and are often referred to as Alerts. Alerts are used to convey information about remittance processing and are never related to a specific adjustment or CARC.\n\nExternal code lists maintained by X12 and external code lists maintained by others and distributed by WPC on behalf of the maintainer can be found here:\n\n[https://x12.org/codes](https://x12.org/codes)\n\nClick on the name of any external code list to access more information about the code list, view the codes, or submit a maintenance request.
