# FHIR-29796 PDex Device uses base resource not US Core Implantable Device Profile. Pdex-Device enables payers to record non-implantable device data. CGP Voted on variance approval: Drew Torres/Eric Haas: 9-0-0
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex/StructureDefinition/pdex-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile

# No HTML is used in the source FSH file.
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/pdex-medicationdispense: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[35].mapping[0].map The string value contains embedded HTML tags. Note that all inputs should be escaped when rendered to HTML as a matter of course
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/pdex-medicationdispense: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[28].mapping[0].map: The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML withour appropraite post-processing, it may be a security risk
