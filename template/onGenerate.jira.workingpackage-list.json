  "introduction": "The Payer Data Exchange (PDex) Implementation Guide (IG) is provided for Payers/Health Plans to enable them to create a Member’s Health History using clinical resources (based on US Core Profiles based on FHIR R4) which can be understood by providers and, if they choose to, committed to their Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System. This IG uses the same Member Health History payload for member-authorized exchange of information with other Health Plans and with Third-Party Applications. It describes the interaction patters that, when followed, allow the various parties involved in managing healthcare and payer data to more easily integrate and exchange data securely and effectively.",
