It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.\nFeedback is welcome and may be submitted through the FHIR JIRA tracker indicating US Da Vinci PDex as the specification. If balloting on this IG, please submit your comments via the tracker and reference them in your ballot submission implementation guide.\n\nThis guide can be reviewed offline.

It describes the interaction patterns that, when followed, allow the various parties involved in managing healthcare and payer data to more easily integrate and exchange data securely and effectively.\n\nThis IG covers the exchange of:\n- Claims-based information\n- Clinical Information (such as Lab Results, Allergies and Conditions)\n\nThis IG covers the exchange of this information using US Core and Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HRex) Profiles. This superset of clinical profiles forms the Health Plan Member's Health History. \n\nThis IG covers the exchange of a Member's Health History in the following scenarios:\n- Provider requested Provider-Health Plan Exchange using CDS-Hooks and SMART-on-FHIR\n- Member-authorized Health Plan to Health Plan exchange\n- Member-authorized Health Plan to Third-Party Application exchange\n\nThe latter two scenarios are provided to meet the requirements identified in the CMS Interoperability Notice for Proposed Rule Making issued on February 11, 2019.\n\n**There are items in this guide that are subject to update**. This includes:\n- Value Sets\n- Vocabularies (X12, NUBC etc.)\n- Examples\n\n**The Vocabulary, Value Sets and codings used to express data in this IG are subject to review and will be reconciled with**  [X12](http://www.x12.org).\n\nSee the [Table of Contents](toc.html) for more information.\n","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"urn:iso:std:iso:3166","code":"US"}]}],"packageId":"hl7.fhir.us.davinci-pdex","license":"CC0-1.0","fhirVersion":["4.0.1"],"dependsOn":[{"id":"hl7_fhir_us_core","uri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.core","packageId":"hl7.fhir.us.core","version":"3.1.0"}],"definition":{"resource":[{"reference":{"reference":"StructureDefinition/pdex-device"},"name":"PDex Device","description":"The PDex Device profile is provided to enable payers to record information about\ndevices used by a member that may not have a UDI number.","exampleBoolean":false},{"reference":{"reference":"StructureDefinition/pdex-medicationdispense"},"name":"PDex MedicationDispense","description":"Prescription Medications dispensed by a pharmacy to a health plan member and paid for in full, or in part, by the health plan","exampleBoolean":false},{"reference":{"reference":"StructureDefinition/pdex-origin-provenance"},"name":"PDex Origin Provenance","description":"Provenance is provided by\nthe payer to identify the source of the information, whether the data came via a clinical record\nor a claim record and whether the data was subject to manual transcription or other interpretive transformation.\nThis profile adds PayerSourceFormat as an extension on the entity base element.\n","exampleBoolean":false},{"reference":{"reference":"StructureDefinition/pdex-server-capabilitystatement"},"name":"Server CapabilityStatement profile for PDex with US Core","description":"CapabilityStatement server profile.
